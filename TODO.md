# Fixed: Deleted Files Handling in pinjected-reviewer

## Problem
The current implementation reviews changed files but attempts to review deleted files, causing the program to crash.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `changed_python_files_in_project` function in `src/pinjected_reviewer/pytest_reviewer/coding_rule_plugin_impl.py` gets information about changed files from `git_info` but doesn't filter out deleted files. When the review process tries to read the content of these files, the program crashes because the files no longer exist.

## Solution Implemented

1. Updated `changed_python_files_in_project` to check and filter out deleted files:
   - Added code to check the `is_deleted` property from `git_info.file_diffs`
   - Added file existence check to ensure only existing files are processed

2. Enhanced file handling throughout the codebase:
   - Added file existence checks to `a_detect_injected_function_call_without_requesting`
   - Added try-except blocks to handle file read errors
   - Added similar error handling to `a_symbol_metadata_getter` and other related functions 

3. Refactored `a_collect_imported_symbol_metadata` to:
   - Be simpler and more robust
   - Handle file existence checks properly
   - Return empty results when files are missing

4. Added comprehensive test coverage:
   - Tests for handling non-existent files
   - Tests for handling deleted files
   - Tests to verify deleted files are filtered out of the review process

## Improved Robustness
The code now gracefully handles various file system edge cases:
- Deleted files (whether by git or externally)
- Non-existent files
- Files with permission issues or other read errors

These changes ensure the pinjected-reviewer continues to function correctly even when files are deleted during the review process.
